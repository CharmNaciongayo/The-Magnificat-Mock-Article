        <div class=article-column id=article-body>New faces, new experiences, <strong>new normal.</strong><br><br>The upcoming school year can feel like a paragliding accident, crash-falling into outlandish, undiscovered territory, certainly a different encounter for everyone. As you start venturing
            into this new, uncharted environment, you’ll find another set of trials and tribulations waiting for a moment to pounce at you. If you’re not careful, you might get lost in all the chaos, desperately hoping that the universe has enough mercy
            to bring you back to safety. So, tighten your safety belts and hold on to your helmets as you let this parachute guide you above and around the tall trees and prickly bushes of the thick, adventure-filled jungle called high school. <br><br>

            </div><br> The Start of Something New.<br><br>Freshman year. It’s time to calm the nervous, but excited, butterflies in your stomach, take a deep breath, and step inside the campus you’ve been watching from afar. Be ready to meet new traditions,
            systems, and a fair share of challenges. Wear those yellow PE shirts with pride and welcome yourself into the MCHS family.<br><br><strong>1. Beginning Again</strong><br>If last year wasn’t exactly your year, that’s okay! We’ve all been there;
            we’ve all had a few mishaps here and there, but that doesn’t mean you have to drown yourself in tears and self-pity. You aren’t defined by your past, so stop dwelling on it. You might not be able to travel back in time, but you can still turn
            things around this year. Think of this as a blank canvas, an empty chapter—you decide how it gets filled. Study up for a subject you failed, be more active in class, or befriend the people you were too shy to approach. There’s no shame in
            starting fresh. This is your chance to redefine yourself and be the person you aspire to be, your chance to have the high school experience you’ve dreamt about. This is a clean slate— take advantage of it.<br><br><strong>2. Polished Armour</strong><br>Between
            all the requirements, groupworks and deadlines, high school can get pretty hectic, pretty fast. Not to scare you, but you might find yourself spiraling downwards as the year goes on. You’ll be worn out so thin, you feel like you’re one step
            away from bursting into tears. Don’t worry, there’s nothing wrong with that; you shouldn’t be ashamed of letting your frustrations out, but you can’t have a breakdown <em>every single time</em> things go south. High school is tough, maybe
            you should be too. Learn how to cope with difficult situations. When something goes wrong, don’t panic and mope around, instead use it as fuel to toughen up. Start familiarizing yourself with resilience and perseverance and you’ll be okay.<br><br><strong>3. You're not alone</strong><br>Adjusting
            to a new environment is always difficult. There’s a new place you have to learn to navigate, unfamiliar faces walking around in the hallways, and a completely different culture to get used to. This change of scenery might overwhelm you, so
            don’t hesitate to reach out to your Blue, Pink, and Green ates. Don’t be shy to ask them anything and everything regarding this new world you’ve stumbled upon. From study tips to house cup points, freeloaders and to GATC crushes—you might
            even get to find out some campus secrets (although, nothing of the magical sort, sadly). And to all of the fellow older MCHS students, we had an encouraging team of older sisters who lent more than a helping hand in our freshman year, it won’t
            hurt to continue the tradition and entertain Yellow’s questions and queries, no matter how silly they may seem. <br><br>
